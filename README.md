## _Abstarct_
In this project, we need to create a simple responsive web application that loads dynamic data through an API and displays it in a novel way.

We need to use Glam API to display dynamic data in an interesting way. Other requirements are to use HTML CSS Javascript & jquery to bring this challenging project to life. First I needed to decide which API I needed to select so I decided to have NMA( National Museum of Australia) API. The documentation of NMA API was very helpful. The concept of how to use and display the data was very easy to understand. I also needed to have a geolocation API to get the user browser location,  which is very useful these days in modern technology to push data according to the location of the user. After I got the API keys of both Source supplier websites. I needed to work on the layout and the UI design of the web app. An example is also given on Canvas [Spotify Wrapped](https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/02/spotify-launches-2020-wrapped-with-new-features-including-quizzes-badges-and-yes-stories) on how to display the data. I also did some research on popular [web apps](https://www.simicart.com/blog/progressive-web-apps-examples/) in 2021.

>  Design inspiration

 I got some ideas of the UI interface design to implant into codes to develop my API sketch for this challenging project. It was a little hard at first and I was very confused about where to start but with the help of Canvas Modules set up By Dr, Ben with API to HTML1 and API to HTML 2 and Geolocation codes link also referred to Github made it easy and some ideas of the project made it little easy to understand of project requirements. After going through research and documentation I had to do a front and back end development of the web app which was quite challenging and interesting. After the code developments, I had to check on the local server and see how it looks. The API of NMA was not displaying some of the images so I got some images manually to look interactive with the UI interface. After getting some feedback from Dr, Ben I tried to improve some of the UI problems. I learnt a lot through this project and found how data can be displayed through API and how to deliver to the user with the UI-friendly interface. Now itâ€™s time to upload to the hosting server and see how it is up and running. I first utilized Github pages hosting to deployed the app project.Then I also tried on an other server to check how its up and ruuing .The project also needs to be on GitHub to make it public and link to Canvas.Throuhg this project I learnt a lot how to use Github pages and how to create the markdown file.
